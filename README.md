# BlockChainSimulator
Hi!

In this repository i have uploaded an implementation of doubly linked lists in Java. Doubly linked lists are recursive data structures that store the memory address of the next and previous node for quick data traversal.

Blockchains are based on this phenomenon of doubly linked list, therefore i have written an implementation for a Blockchain simulator as well.

I have also written Junit test to ensure the methods implemented in their respective classes work based on input-output predictions.
